# Service Mesh / Istio: Study

** Service Mesh: An Extra layer in the cluster to monitor and modify in real time the app trafics, as well as level up the security and confiability of the ecosystem

** Istio: It is an opensource project that implements Service Mesh, independently of the language or technology (it works with kubernetes, apache mesos, nomad, etc.)

** Istio creates a proxy inside each POD to receive and to send data between pods. Thorough a Istio control panel layer (in a specific POD), it controls all the proxys
